> ### Event Driven Architecture Vanilla JS Web Components codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.

### [Demo](https://weedshaker.github.io/event-driven-web-components-realworld-example-app)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with Event Driven Vanilla JS Web Components including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **Document Object Model (DOM)** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.


# How it works

> Frontend Event Driven Architecture works basically like the DOM itself. There are loosely coupled components (nodes), which emmit events and those get captured by controllers called stores, routers, etc. 

# Getting started

> Simply open the index.html on a local or remote web server like, node, apache, nginx, etc.
